**Chapter 11: Project Risk Management**

7 processes

Planning

    11.1 Plan Risk Managament
    11.2 Identify Risks
    11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analisys
    11.4 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
    11.5 Plan Risk Response

Executing
    
    11.6 Implement Risk Responses
    
Monitoring and Controlling
    
    11.7 Monitor Risks
    
+ 11.1: Define the code of conduct for the project's risk management activities
+ 11.2: Identify the individual risks and global risks, and file their characteristic
+ 11.3: Hierarchize individual risks for later analyze and action by evaluating their probability and impact
+ 11.4: Put a cost to the combined identified individual risks and other uncertainty sources
+ 11.5: Develop options, strategies and actions to manage the exposure to global risks and treat each individual risks
+ 11.6: Execute the response plan to risks
+ 11.7: Follow the implementation of the response plans, monitor the identified risks, identify new ones, evaluate the 
efficiency of the risk management process during the project duration

2 levels of risks
+ Individual: Event or condition that realization would have a positive or negative impact on one or several objectives
of the project
+ Global: Effect of the uncertainty on the whole project, which represent the exposure of the stakeholders to the 
implications of the variations of the project's results

Individual risks can be either positive (opportunity) or negative (threat), risk management aims to exploit or 
strengthen opportunities while avoiding or soften threats.

To efficiently manage risks, the team, must know the exposure level to the risks that is acceptable to follow the 
objectives. This level is defined by thresholds of measurable risks. 

### Plan Risk Management

**Input Data**

+ Project Charter
+ Project Management Plan
+ Project Documents
+ Enterprise Environmental Factors
+ Organizational Process Assets

**Tools and Techniques**

+ Expert Judgement 
+ Data Analysis
+ Meetings

**Output Data**

+ Risk Management plan

**Risk Management Plan**
    
    Risk Strategy
        Describe the global approach adopted to manage the risk of the project
    Method
        Define the approaches, tools and data sources that will be used to manage risk
    Roles and Responsabilities
        Define the team members in charge of the leading, the support activities and risks management for each activity 
        type described in the plan.
    Funding
        Establish the fund required to realize the  risk management activities
    Schedule
        Self explanatory
    Risk category
        Give a way to gather individual risks. They are often strucutured in an organization chart (the Risk Breakdown 
        Structure, RBS). It shows a hierachical representation of the sources of the potential risks.
