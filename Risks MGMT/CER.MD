Monitoring and Controlling
    
    11.7 Monitor Risks
    
+ 11.1: Define the code of conduct for the project's risk management activities
+ 11.2: Identify the individual risks and global risks, and file their characteristic
+ 11.3: Hierarchize individual risks for later analyze and action by evaluating their probability and impact
+ 11.4: Put a cost to the combined identified individual risks and other uncertainty sources
+ 11.5: Develop options, strategies and actions to manage the exposure to global risks and treat each individual risks
+ 11.6: Execute the response plan to risks
+ 11.7: Follow the implementation of the response plans, monitor the identified risks, identify new ones, evaluate the 
efficiency of the risk management process during the project duration

2 levels of risks
+ Individual: Event or condition that realization would have a positive or negative impact on one or several objectives
of the project
+ Global: Effect of the uncertainty on the whole project, which represent the exposure of the stakeholders to the 
implications of the variations of the project's results

Individual risks can be either positive (opportunity) or negative (threat), risk management aims to exploit or 
strengthen opportunities while avoiding or soften threats.

To efficiently manage risks, the team, must know the exposure level to the risks that is acceptable to follow the 
objectives. This level is defined by thresholds of measurable risks.
